## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies and shows based on the features of the items themselves (e.g., genre, director, cast).
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to rate movies and shows, and receive recommendations accordingly.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the recommendation process and user interactions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and testing the notebook examples)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/Netflix-Movies-and-Shows-Recommendation.git
   cd Netflix-Movies-and-Shows-Recommendation
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary Netflix dataset or use a sample dataset .

## Usage

### Running the Recommender System

To run the recommender system, execute the following script:

```sh
python recommender.py
```

This will start the recommendation process and provide recommendations based on the implemented algorithms.

### Jupyter Notebook

For an interactive exploration and to see how the recommendation algorithms are implemented, open the `Netflix_Recommender.ipynb` notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook Netflix_Recommender.ipynb
```

This notebook contains detailed explanations and visualizations to help you understand the recommendation process.
